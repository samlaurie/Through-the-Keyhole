# Through-the-Keyhole

A model of a 1950’s Australian kitchen based on and inspired items and images from the collection at the National Museum of Australia as well as digitised archives of The Australian Women’s Weekly through The National Library’s Trove.

This project is for HUMN6003 Digital Humanities and Public Culture: Projects and Engagement as part of the Masters of Digital Humanities at the Australian National University in collaboration with the National Museum of Australia. This project is aimed at lower primary school children, to encourage imagining what the past was like and empathising with people throughout history.
